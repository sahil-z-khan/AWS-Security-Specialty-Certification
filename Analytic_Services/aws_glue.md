# 🧮 AWS Glue

**Purpose:**  
A **serverless data integration and ETL service** that prepares and moves data for analytics, AI, and security use cases.

---

## 🔑 What It Does
- **Extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL)** data between sources like S3, RDS, Redshift, and more.  
- Automatically **discovers and catalogs metadata** in the **Glue Data Catalog**.  
- Runs **serverless ETL jobs** using Apache Spark or Python.  
- Integrates with **Lake Formation** for fine-grained data access control.

## ⚙️ Key Security Use Cases
| Scenario | Example |
|-----------|----------|
| Data classification | Use Glue Data Catalog to label and identify sensitive data for Macie scans. |
| Access control | Integrate with **Lake Formation** and **IAM** to manage dataset permissions. |
| Encryption | Encrypt data at rest in S3, catalog metadata, and connections with **KMS**. |
| Auditing | Log Glue job runs and access via **CloudTrail** for compliance. |

---

## 🧭 Integrations
- **Lake Formation:** Centralized permissions and data governance.  
- **Macie:** Sensitive data discovery using Glue Data Catalog.  
- **KMS:** Encrypt job bookmarks, scripts, and metadata.  
- **CloudTrail / CloudWatch:** Track job activity and monitor ETL performance.  
- **S3 / Redshift / RDS:** Common data sources and destinations.

## 💡 Exam Tips
- **Glue = Data catalog + ETL orchestration**, not a threat detection tool.  
- All **API calls logged** in **CloudTrail**.  
- Supports **IAM-based authorization** + **KMS encryption**.  
- Often appears in **data governance** or **compliance** scenarios.  
- *Exam trigger:* “Need to manage, classify, or encrypt analytics data pipelines.” → ✅ **Glue**
